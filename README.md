## Guide

### 1. Download JKSV and switch-time
Before we begin, we need right tools for backup savegame, restore BCAT and set synced time.
1. Download latest [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases) version from the [release page](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases).  
   The current version is from 4th April, but you should always prefer the latest one.
   
2. To download a file from a GitHub release, first of all expand "Assets", then in the most cases there is an nro file or an archive like a zip. In this case we need only the **JKSV.nro**.

3. The same is for the [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time/releases) homebrew.
   Download the nro from the latest release.  
    ![switch-time-release](resources/tools/switch-time-release.png)
4. Now copy **JKSV.nro** and **switch-time.nro** to the switch directory on your sd card.  
   I'm using FTP for it and it looks like this.

### 2. Create a savegame backup
